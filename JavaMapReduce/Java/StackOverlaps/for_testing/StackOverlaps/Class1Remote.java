 * The <code>Class1Remote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant interface to MATLAB 
 * functions. The interface is compiled from the following files:
 * <pre>
 *  C:\\Users\\Seyed\\Documents\\DatasetTests\\registrar\\registrar\\JavaMapReduce\\StackOverlaps.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a <code>Class1Remote</code> 
 * instance when it is no longer needed to ensure that native resources allocated by this 
 * class are properly freed, and the server-side proxy is unexported.  (Failure to call 
 * dispose may result in server-side threads not being properly shut down, which often 
 * appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of StackOverlaps.Class1.
